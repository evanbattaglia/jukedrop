- Flux -- add DidUnmount -> removeEventListener
- fluxize more -- DropboxFile stuff, Audio. but simple enough for now.
  (when we get to stopping, continuous loading, etc., it will probably require more)
- multiple playlists
- continuous playing of playlists (eventually, with anticipated loading)
- exporting of playlists (eventually, to Dropbox)
- separate jsx files compiled into one index.html (for use on local filesystem file:/// URL)
- hierarchy of playlists, like I always wanted in a jukebox
- set accesstoken on first load & store in localstorage, for stupid-simple setup
- loading of directories for quick search
- id3 tags? probably not... maybe just directory name in playlist (good for artists directory)
