- continuous playing of playlists (eventually, with anticipated loading)
  - maybe via a "coming up next queue"? that could be a list similar
    to a playlist that listens to audio end event and deletse things
    at the top. then add a playlist "add all to queue"
- exporting of playlists (eventually, to Dropbox)
  (playlists to dropbox will be important so can have playlists shared between computers!)
- search bar for directory

- make it so "add" doesn't appear if you don't have a selected playlist
  -> hook up playlist change to have state in filelist, "hasCurrentPlaylist"
- rename playlist
- Flux -- add DidUnmount -> removeEventListener
- linting
- fluxize more -- DropboxFile stuff, Audio. but simple enough for now.
  (when we get to stopping, continuous loading, etc., it will probably require more)

- hierarchy of playlists, like I always wanted in a jukebox
- set accesstoken on first load & store in localstorage, for stupid-simple setup
- settings area with accesstoken and default directory

- loading of directories for quick search
- id3 tags? probably not... maybe just directory name in playlist (good for artists directory)
