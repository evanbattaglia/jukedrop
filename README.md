# Requirements
- Nothing but a web browser.

# Building
```
npm install
npm run dist
cd dist/
```

# Setup (prebuilt version, forthcoming)
It's easy as 1-2-3.
1. create an app & authtoken in dropbox.
2. copy config.js.example to dist/config.js and add in your authtoken.
3. then just go open index.html in a web browser (Chrome recommended)
